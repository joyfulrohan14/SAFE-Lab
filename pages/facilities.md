The Cyber-Physical Systems Lab (CyPhy Lab) is located on the third floor of the
Mathematics Building in room 307. The CyPhy Lab is a part of the Information
Assurance (IA) program with Dr. Irfan Ahmed serving as lab director. The
Cyber-Physical Systems Lab contains a state-of-the-art model test bed
of control systems—often called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
Systems—designed to supervise industrial processes at work. The "test bed"
contains scale versions of three different systems—a pipeline, a water treatment
plant and a power plant—and allows accurate simulation of each. Each utility
system is connected to dedicated computer controls that students can use to
study, experiment and acquire data. The test beds rely on instruments from
Allen-Bradley, Siemens, and Schneider Electric—manufacturers that supply
real-world control systems for utilities worldwide. The CyPhy Lab is currently
developing tools and techniques to facilitate digital forensic investigations in
industrial control systems. Such forensics can be difficult because these
systems may use proprietary and legacy hardware and operating systems. A
detailed listing of the CyPhy Lab equipment is provided below:

Laptop and Software
-------------------

The Dell Latitude Laptop communicates with the Simulators to receive data to
display on the HMI. It can be connected to any network connection in the system.
The laptop has the ability to retrieve data from any of the PLCs in the system.
The HMI software, PLC Programming Software and the Communication Software will
reside on this laptop.

Pipeline Simulator
------------------

The pipeline simulator consists of an air compressor, valves and piping to
simulate a pipeline monitoring system. The pressure in the pipeline can be set
to maintain a pressure and the pressure can be bled off using a solenoid valve.
The solenoid valve can be used to simulate a break in the line or normal usage
in a system.

Waste Water Treatment Simulator
-------------------------------

The wastewater treatment simulator consists of a circulation water pump that
keeps the water circulating through the plant. The water will flow through a
simulated filter and clarifier to clean the water in the system. The system will
monitor the flow and other simulated values.

Power Plant Simulator
---------------------

The power plant simulator consists of transformers to simulate the process of a
power generating plant and transformers to simulate remote substations for
step-up or step-down voltages. Voltage sensors will be located at incoming and
outgoing sources and power parameters will be displayed on the HMI.
